Visualising 19th Century Australian Readerships
===============================================

This web page is a companion to a chapter appearing in "Resourceful Reading" by Sydney University Press. The chapter details are:

> J. Lamond and M. Reid, _Squinting at a Sea of Dots: Visualising Australian Readerships using Statistical Machine Learning_, 2009.

The visualisation application aims to present information from the [Australian Common Reader database](http://www.australiancommonreader.com/wp-database/index.php) in a easy-to-navigate and interactive form.

The application is currently under redevelopment and will appear here when complete. The original version is no longer available due to technical considerations.

More details about some of the algorithms used to lay out the visualisation are discussed in a [companion blog post](/blog/visualising-19th-century-reading.html).
