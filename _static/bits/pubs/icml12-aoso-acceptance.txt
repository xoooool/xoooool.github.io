Dear Mark Reid,

Your paper, 569  Title: AOSO-LogitBoost: Adaptive One-Vs-One LogitBoost for Multi-Class Problem
has been accepted for presentation at the 29th International
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012) to be held in Edinburgh,
Scotland, on June 26–July 1, 2012.  A total of 890 papers were
submitted to the technical program.  The program committee selected 243
of those for presentation at the conference (27.3% acceptance rate).

Due to the very large increase in submissions, we need to alter the
conference format.  An earlier survey ( http://www.icml2010.org/ReportAndSurvey/ICML2010ProcessAndSurvey.html )
suggests poster-only papers are preferred.  However, we want to preserve
the "everyone presents" tradition of ICML.  To do this, some of the papers
will be presented as short (5min.) talks, while others will be presented
as longer (20min.) talks.  All papers will also be presented as
posters.  The short vs long talk assignments will be communicated to
authors by May 13, along with the full program.  No distinction will
be made in the conference proceedings based on the assigned
presentation format.

For those interested, a full description of the reviewing process
will be posted shortly at http://hunch.net .

You can log into CMT to see the reviews and meta-review(s) of your paper:

The camera-ready version of your paper is due May 21.  Instructions
will be sent shortly. Please carefully consider the program
committee’s comments when preparing your final version.  Feel free to
contact us for clarifications if necessary.

Applications for student support (travel scholarships and volunteer
positions) will be accepted until May 6:

We're looking forward to a great ICML.  See you in Edinburgh!
