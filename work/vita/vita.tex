\begin{itemize}%
\item Research Fellow, \emph{\href{http://cs.anu.edu.au/}{Research School of Computer Science}, The \href{http://anu.edu.au/}{Australian National University}, Canberra}

As part of the \href{http://ai.cecs.anu.edu.au/}{Artificial Intelligence group} at the \href{http://cs.anu.edu.au/}{Research School of Computer Science} I am investigating theoretical representations of and relationships between different types of machine learning problems. To date, this work has led to some deep connections between various notions of risk, information and divergences for binary classification problems as well as potentially fruitful connections to prediction markets.

I am also co-leading the Linkage project \emph{Protocols and Structures for Inference} with Canon Research to develop specifications for exposing machine learning algorithms as web services.



\end{itemize}
\hypertarget{20052007}{}\subsubsection*{{2005--{}2007}}\label{20052007}

\begin{itemize}%
\item Senior Research Engineer, \emph{\href{http://www.cisra.com.au/}{Canon Information Research Systems Australia}, Sydney}

As a research engineer I have investigated, implemented, evaluated and applied for patents for novel machine learning algorithms which solve problems related to Canon'{}s business interests. I have taken a primary role in three research projects and contributed to several others. During this time I have familiarised myself with research into ensemble methods, Bayesian inference, cost-sensitive learning, kernel methods, and spectral methods for dimensional reduction. Some of these techniques were evaluated on large, noisy, high-dimensional datasets. My other responsibilities include managing an undergraduate intern, presentation of machine learning papers to CISRA'{}s journal club, various software engineering tasks and patent activities.



\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}%
\item Research Officer, \emph{\href{http://www.smartservicescrc.com.au/AboutUs.html}{Smart Internet Technology CRC}, Sydney}

As a part-time research officer I developed a user interface for a handheld device as part of a technology demonstration for a mobile communications project. I also added some extensions to a Java messaging framework and audited it for J2ME compliance.

\begin{itemize}%
\item Senior Developer, \emph{\href{http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/177083/compuware_acquires_local_r_d_centre/}{Proxima Technology}, Sydney}

During my part-time work at Proxima I developed various aspects of the company'{}s flagship product: Centauri, an IT services monitoring and reporting tool. This included: researching machine learning approaches to predicting service faults; implementing a parser and interpreter for a language expressing service contracts; creating tools for automated building, testing and packaging; and instigating the use of a wiki for improved developer communication.

\begin{itemize}%
\item Co-Op Research Intern, \emph{\href{http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml}{IBM T.J. Watson Research}, New York}

IBM'{}s Co-Op program employs postgraduate students to work full-time under a mentor on one of their research projects. 2001 was the first year the position was open to Australian students and I was one of only six successful applicants to be selected. My work on this project resulted in a system which could build skill profiles for employees by analysing the collections of unstructured text documents they view or author.

\hypertarget{20092012}{}\subsubsection*{{2009--{}2012}}\label{20092012}

\begin{itemize}%
\item Co-Chief Investigator (with Robert Williamson), ARC Linkage Project \emph{Structures and Protocols for Inference}. Linkage Partner: \href{http://www.cisra.com.au/}{Canon Information Systems Research Australia} (CISRA)

The aim of this project is to make it easier to get machine learning tools into the hands of people who work with data. To do this we plan to develop an inferential architecture for machine learning technology comprising protocols and data structures that allow the use and composition of a variety of software toolkits while avoiding the problems described above. The end result will be a means to use inferential technology that neither requires expert knowledge of the inner workings, nor the learning of a new language and API for each new toolkit.

Total Funding: A\$445,000 over 3 years (ARC + CISRA).
