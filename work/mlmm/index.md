# Composing Machine Learning via Market Mechanisms

(Coming soon!)

<!--
> 1. To what extend can pricing or other market mechanisms be interpreted as
>    learning algorithms.
> 
> 2. Can well-understood learning algorithms be used to create novel market
>    mechanisms? (e.g., Structured SVM work by Parkes et al.)
> 
> 3. How might we use market mechanisms to combine predictions, predictors, 
>    and learning algorithms to solve complex problem involving heterogeneous
>    data?
