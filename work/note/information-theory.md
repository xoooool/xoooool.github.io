Information theory is the study of the fundamental limits of communication and coding. It is by no means my area of expertise but, since I keep bumping into concepts like entropy, uncertainty, and [compression](/iem/a-compression-lemma.html) in [my own work](/work/pubs/) and many of the papers I read, I figured I should delve deeper into the subject.

I've found some good starting points on the subject, including (in roughly increasing order of technicality) MacKay's excellent [freely available book][mackay03], the classic "Elements of Information Theory" by Cover and Thomas, and Robert Gray's "Entropy and Information Theory". 

Also, be sure to check out [Maxim Raginsky][maxim]'s blog: [The Information Structuralist][infostruct].
