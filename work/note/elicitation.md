A perennial problem in economics is that of designing incentives that will elicit truthful beliefs from rational subjects.

> Properties of proper scoring rules from the economics literature are exploited to present a simple derivation of regret bounds (old and new) for binary classification. We also show some connections with Bregman divergences and canonical links.

> In the context of distributions over a finite set, this work characterises which properties (functions from distributions to reals) are elicitable (i.e., for which a scoring rule exists) in terms of the geometry of the pre-images of the properties. It also introduces the notion of complexity for vectors of properties and poses questions about them.
