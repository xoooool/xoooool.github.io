Notebooks
=========

This is a collection of summaries of various topics that I am interested in. These include my own personal (and possibly incorrect!) take on some of the high-level ideas, pr√©cis of what I believe to be key papers and links to related material.

* [Transfer and Multitask Learning](transfer-multitask.html)
* [Statistical Learning Theory](learning-theory.html) (Overviews)
* Kernel Methods
* Online Learning
* PAC-Bayesian Bounds

_Of course, it would be remiss for this collection of notes not to have an awed nod to Cosma's  [notebooks](http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/)_.
