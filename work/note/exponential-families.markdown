# Exponential Families

Exponential families are a well-studied class of parametric probability distributions that have a simple mathematical form which give rise to a number of useful properties.

They also have intriguing connections with Bregman divergences, as shown by @Banerjee:2005.

One of the best non-technical introductions I've read on the topic is the chapter on Exponential Families in Peter GrÃ¼nwald's book _The Minimum Description Length Principle_ [-@Grunwald:2007].

Cosma Shalizi has a note on [Exponential Families of Probability Measures](http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/exponential-families.html) from which I pilfered some references.
