I'm a Research Fellow in the 
[Research School of Computer Science][rscs] 
at the [Australian National University][anu] in Canberra, Australia and a 
contributed researcher to [NICTA][]'s [Machine Learning][sml] research group.

My current research interests include: loss functions in statistical and online 
learning, and connections between learning theory and market mechanisms.

Objective
=========
My research vision can be distilled down to wanting to **build theoretical and practical foundations for wide-spread, machine-assisted inference**. I am doing so through the following funded projects:

 - [Composing Machine Learning via Market Mechanisms](/work/mlmm)    
   ([Discovery Early Career Researcher Award](http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/decra.htm): 2013--2016)

 - [Protocols and Structures for Inference][psi]    
   ([ARC Linkage](http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/lp/lp_default.htm) with [CISRA](http://cisra.com.au) until 2013).

<div class="section">
Publications
============
I have [published][] research in variety of areas including, most recently: learning theory, prediction markets, and boosting. A complete list is available at [my publications page][published].

Teaching
========
I am convening and co-lecturing a course on [Information Theory (COMP2610)](http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2610/) with [Aditya Menon](http://cs.anu.edu.au/user/5022) in semester 2, 2013. I previously taught this with [Edwin Bonilla](http://people.cecs.anu.edu.au/user/4101) in 2011 and 2012. I also co-lectured [Advanced Topics in Statistical Machine Learning (COMP8650)](http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/info/comp8650/overview) in semester 2, 2012.

<div class="section">
Students
========
I am currently primary supervisor for three PhD students:[Avi Ruderman][], [Nicolás Della Penna][], and [Mindika Premachandra][]. I also supervise [Nam Ho](http://maths.anu.edu.au/about-us/people/nam-ho), an Honours Student at the [Mathematical Sciences Institute](http://maths.anu.edu.au). 

I am **not** looking to supervise any more students at present.

Blog
====
Since September 2007 I have kept a blog on machine learning and statistical 
inference called _[Inductio ex Machina](/blog/)_.

Activities
==========
I am currently the Production Editor for the [JMLR Workshop & Conference Proceedings](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/). I am also an Action Editor for the JMLR's [Machine Learning and Open Source Software](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/mloss/) track.

I was a member of the program committee for [ICML 2013](http://icml.cc/2013/).
I was local organiser for [ALT 2010](http://www-alg.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~thomas/ALT10/alt10.jhtml) as well as a member of its [Program Committee](http://www-alg.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~thomas/ALT10/pc.html). I have also been on the program committee for [NIPS 2012](http://nips.cc/Conferences/2012/Committees),  [ACML 2012](http://acml12.comp.nus.edu.sg/), and [AI12](http://ai2012.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/index.html).

I have reviewed for journals ([JMLR][], [JAIR][], [PAMI][], [TCS][], [Trans. on Info. Theory][infotheory], [Trans. on NNLS][nnls], [PloS ONE][], and [AMS Mathematical Reviews][amsmr]), conferences (including [NIPS][], [ICML][], [COLT][], and [UAI][]),
and have also set up a [discussion site][icmldisc] for ICML and [presented][mlss2009] at the 2009 Machine Learning Summer School. 

I have also participated in the [Mathematicians in Schools](http://www.mathematiciansinschools.edu.au/) program as a partner with Yass High School.
