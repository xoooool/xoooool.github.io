title: ML Discuss for ICML 2011
excerpt: A brief note about the ML Discuss site for ICML 2011.
location: Canberra, Australia

[ICML 2011](http://www.icml-2011.org/) is just around the corner so, with the help of some of the [conference organisers](http://www.icml-2011.org/organization.php), I recently updated the [ML Discuss site](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com) I set up last year[^1] to allow everyone to [comment on accepted papers at ICML 2011](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/).

If you are an [author](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/author/) of a paper in ICML 2011, I urge you to find your papers and subscribe to their comment feeds via email or RSS. Instructions can be found on the [main page](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/). Of course, you can also subscribe to comments for papers you are interested in even if you are not an author.

Last year at [ICML 2010](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2010/) most of the online discussion happened during the conference itself. I expect that will also be the case this year but I would encourage people—even those, like me, who are not attending ICML 2011—to start commenting now. If you are after somewhere to start I would recommend checking out the Best and Distinguished Papers:

- [Computational Rationalization: The Inverse Equilibrium Problem](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/599/)
- [Submodular meets Spectral: Greedy Algorithms for Subset Selection, Sparse Approximation and Dictionary Selection](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/542/)
- [Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/456/)
- [Minimum Probability Flow Learning](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/480/)
- [Approximate Dynamic Programming for Storage Problems](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/235/)
- [Predicting Legislative Roll Calls from Text](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/333/)
- [Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks](http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/venue/ICML/2011/article/125/)


Looking ahead, I spent some time making sure the current version of ML Discuss can handle multiple conferences and separately track the top and recent comments for each. If you are a conference organiser for another machine learning-related conference and would like to have it discussed at ML Discuss, drop me an [email](mailto:mark@reid.name) and let me know. All that I require is a text file containing all the accepted papers, along with their authors and abstracts.

Happy commenting!
