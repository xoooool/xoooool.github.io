title: NIPS 2011 Workshop on Relations Between Machine Learning Problems
excerpt: I am co-organising a workshop at this year's NIPS to look at how we might better understand machine learning problems by examining their relationships to each other.
location: Canberra, Australia
---

There is now a bewildering array of inference problems that techniques from
machine learning can address: classification, regression, density estimation,
clustering, ranking, recommendation, feature selection, hypothesis testing,
and more. Multiply this by some of the modes in which learning can occur (batch vs. 
online, active vs. passive, partial vs. full feedback, inductive vs. transductive,
semi-/un-/supervised) and there is a veritable zoo of problems out there. 

As part of a continuing effort to make sense of it all, [Bob Williamson][],
[John Langford][], [Ulrike von Luxburg][], [Jennifer Wortman Vaughan][], and
I are running a workshop at NIPS this year titled [Relations Between Machine
Learning Problems–an approach to unify the field][rml]:

> This workshop will focus on relations between machine learning problems. 
> The idea is that by better understanding how different machine learning 
> problems relate to each other, we will be able to better understand the 
> field as a whole. 

At this stage we plan to have [Peter Grünwald][] and [Amos Storkey][] give 
invited talks and a panel discussion on "How to build a map of all of machine
learning".

[Submissions][] are due by the end of September.

If you need any further encouragement to join us, I just note that 
the NIPS workshops are in Spain's [Sierra Nevada][] this year.

Hope to see you there!
