The [first Artificial AI][ada] that my
[co-developer](http://twitter.com/#!/JVLamond) and I started almost three years
ago --- project Ada --- is coming along nicely. Her (non-computer) vision,
(non-machine) learning, NLP, and planning systems are coming along nicely. 

Here's a recent screenshot[^1].

Encouraged by the success of the first version of the project we decided to take the plunge and start on version 2. 

We call this version "Edith Valerie Reid".

Her initial release on the 26th of July and so far everything is going really
well. As with the first version, there are some issues to resolve such as
the sleep-synchronisation routines but these are very minor and, from what I've
heard, common to this type of project.

All in all, I'm declaring the version two release a resounding success.
