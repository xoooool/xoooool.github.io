To avoid keeping you in suspense, I'll get this out of the way right up front: [ML Hipster][] is me!

## Who are you talking about?

I started the [ML Hipster][] account on a whim and found it fun to mash up clichés about hipsters and their attitude with jargon from machine learning and statistics.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Is this Bayesian? You know I'm a strict Bayesian, right?</p>&mdash; ML Hipster (@ML_Hipster) <a href="https://twitter.com/ML_Hipster/status/223712846092050432" data-datetime="2012-07-13T09:37:53+00:00">July 13, 2012</a></blockquote>

I guess I was partially inspired by the rash of other technical novelty accounts out there such as [PLT Borat](https://twitter.com/PLT_Borat) and [Hipster Hacker](https://twitter.com/hipsterhacker).

There was also the added enjoyment of obliquely poking fun at what some "old school" machine learning people might think of the recent, "big data"-driven incursion onto <strike>our</strike> (ahem) _their_ turf.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Everyone is all big data this and online that. My methods are small batch: they only handle a few instances but really look at them, y'know?</p>&mdash; ML Hipster (@ML_Hipster) <a href="https://twitter.com/ML_Hipster/status/236227963002159104" data-datetime="2012-08-16T22:28:29+00:00">August 16, 2012</a></blockquote>

Ultimately though, it was really just an excuse to make bad puns that only a select few would understand, let alone find amusing. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>"Oh sure, going in that direction will totally minimize the objective function" —Sarcastic Gradient Descent.</p>&mdash; ML Hipster (@ML_Hipster) <a href="https://twitter.com/ML_Hipster/status/226448024224796673" data-datetime="2012-07-20T22:46:30+00:00">July 20, 2012</a></blockquote>

## Why take off the mask?

To be honest, I had no idea the account would get so popular. So much so that shortly after starting it I promised myself that if it ever got more followers than my [main twitter account](https://twitter.com/mdreid) I'd spill the beans. 

Well, 103 days, 61 tweets, and 1,651 followers later, here I am presiding over scattered legumes. 

## What now?

I have no intention of abandoning [ML Hipster][] and will likely post there whenever I have yet another terrible, technical pun to inflict which I don't want friends and family to hear.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>I prefer Chervonenkis' solo work.</p>&mdash; ML Hipster (@ML_Hipster) <a href="https://twitter.com/ML_Hipster/status/224027751655546880" data-datetime="2012-07-14T06:29:12+00:00">July 14, 2012</a></blockquote>

I'm also not going to reveal who ML Hipster is via that account. I figure there are people following ML Hipster (but not this blog or my other account) who [couldn't care less](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7O0MFkmpw) about who it actually is and I don't want to spoil their fun. 

Or mine.
