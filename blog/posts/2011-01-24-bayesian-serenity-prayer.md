I recently saw this calmly frustrated [tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/johnmyleswhite/status/25405568801837056) by [John Myles White](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/):

> It's odd how much of my life these days is spent fitting models I know are false to data that I believe to be inadequate.

It was a cry for help and I knew he needed some kind, guiding words to help him through his difficult time.
Since Bayesianism is a religion, I [replied](http://twitter.com/#!/mdreid/status/25410699681337345) with a Bayesian version of the [Serenity Prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer). 

Thankfully, I [wasn't the only one](http://favstar.fm/users/mdreid/status/25410699681337345) who found it amusing, so I thought I'd post an extended version here:

> **Bayesian Serenity Prayer**    
> Bayes,    
> grant me the serenity   
> to accept the models are wrong;   
> the courage to clean the data;   
> and wisdom to choose a prior.   
>    
> Updating one datum at a time;    
> Sampling one model at a time;    
> Accepting iteration as the pathway to inference;    
> Taking, as He did, this uncertain world   
> as it might be, not as I would have it;    
> Trusting that He will make all things right   
> if I compute with His rule;   
> So that I may be approximately correct with this prediction    
> and exactly correct with His   
> Forever in the limit.   
> Amen.   

Also: Happy New Year! I'm hoping to get back to some more serious blogging once a number of looming paper deadlines have passed.
