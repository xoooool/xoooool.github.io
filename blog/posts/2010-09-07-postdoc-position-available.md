title: Postdoc Position Available
excerpt: I am advertising for a fixed-term postdoc to join my Structures and Protocols for Inference project.
location: Canberra, Australia

I seemed to have entered a new phase of academic life where, instead of applying for postdoc positions myself, I am able to offer them.

[Bob Williamson][bob] and I have recently secured funding for a research project entitled _Structures and Protocols for Inference_ and we are looking for someone with a machine learning background to join us for 2.5 years as a postdoctoral research fellow. If you think you might be interested read on. If you are _sure_ you are interested, don't waste any more time and head straight over to the [application form][applying].

The text we've sent out with the ad summarises the project best:

> The project goal is to develop an architecture that will improve the interoperability of machine learning software and make those tools more accessible. This requires a systematic exploration of the types of tasks encountered in machine learning, the development of a language to describe inference tasks, and a theory to relate and compose them. 

Essentially, we want to build the foundations of machine learning as web services. While there are already a couple of attempts along these lines---the [Google Prediction API][gpa] being the prominent example---we feel there is room for a broader, more open, more versatile, and consistent approach. 

A necessary component of this work will be a solid theory of task specification (structure) and learner interaction (protocols). As well as guiding the design of the ML-as-service architecture we expect such a theory to help clarify and extend some of our existing work that examines relationships between learning tasks such as regret bounds, reductions, and transfer learning.

So, if you have a solid background in machine learning and a penchant for designing software and services, please consider [applying][] for the position.
