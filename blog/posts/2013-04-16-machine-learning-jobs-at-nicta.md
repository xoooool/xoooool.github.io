This is just a short note to say that the [machine learning group][mlg] that I am a part of at [NICTA][] is [looking to hire][jobs] several new machine learning researchers.
The full details of the positions can be found [here][jobs] and the links therein. 

To summarise:

- Several full-time research positions in machine learning at NICTA are available.
- Positions can be taken up in either the Sydney or Canberra labs.
- Appointments are up to 3 years with the possibility of extension.
- Includes adjunct status at either the [Australian National University][ANU] or the [University of Sydney][USyd], with the ability to supervise PhD students.
- Salaries from \$85,000 to \$100,000 (AUD) per annum.

On a personal note, I've been an ANU-contributed researcher at NICTA for the last four years and find it an excellent place to work. We've got a great collection of people with diverse interests across machine learning, lots of challenging theoretical and applied problems, fantastic students, and a solid publishing record at NIPS, ICML, COLT, and JMLR.

I'm happy to answer any questions about the research environment here. If you want more details about the position and how to apply, please [read the advertisement][jobs] and/or email [Bob Williamson][bob] (ML group leader) at <bob.williamson@nicta.com.au>.
